    Upsamples LR -> target_size in learned 2x stages (sub-pixel convolution +
    residual refinement), one stage per power-of-two the scale factor spans.
    HR is zero-padded 125->128 upstream (see ``multiscale.pad_to_size``) so
    target_size is 128x128 for parquet data — a clean power of two — meaning
    16/32/64 -> 128 all land exactly on an integer number of learned doubling
    stages with no bicubic remainder. The trailing ``F.interpolate(..., size=
    target_size)`` calls are then true no-ops for parquet and only matter as a
    safety net for non-power-of-two targets (e.g. an HDF5 hr_size override).

    At small input resolutions (e.g. 16x16 or 32x32) this staged approach
    builds up structure gradually instead of bicubic-upsampling straight to
    full HR resolution before any learned layer runs, which was smearing
    sparse energy deposits into blurry blobs the residual CNN then had no way
    to recover (16x/32x had near-zero or negative val_psnr_norm vs. 64x's ~9
    under the old single-shot bicubic-residual design).

    ``forward(lr, target_size)`` keeps the same signature as before: the
    number of learned stages is inferred per call from how many times 2x
    fits between the input size and target_size, so one checkpoint still
    works across LR scales.
